**Background:** Parental health-seeking behavior for illnesses among children is critical for timely and appropriate medical care. This study aimed to investigate the influence of sociodemographic factors on parental health-seeking behavior in Karachi, Pakistan.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted among 553 parents/caregivers of children aged 0-5 years. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the associations between sociodemographic factors and parental health-seeking behavior.

**Results:** The majority (75.8%) of parents sought professional medical care for their children's illnesses. The odds of seeking professional medical care were significantly higher among parents with higher education levels (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13-3.33), higher monthly income (AOR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.12-3.12), and those who had health insurance (AOR = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.30-3.59). Conversely, the odds were lower among parents who were unemployed (AOR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.41-0.99).

**Conclusions:** Sociodemographic factors, such as education, income, employment status, and health insurance, significantly influence parental health-seeking behavior for pediatric illnesses in Karachi. Targeted interventions are needed to improve health-seeking behavior among disadvantaged populations.

**Keywords:** Health-seeking behavior, pediatrics, sociodemographic factors, Karachi, Pakistan</h1></header><div class_="entry-content"><p>**Abstract**

**Background:** Parental health-seeking behavior (HSB) for illnesses among children is crucial for child health outcomes. Sociodemographic factors may influence parental HSB, leading to disparities in child health care utilization. This study aimed to investigate the influence of sociodemographic factors on parental HSB in Karachi, Pakistan.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,080 parents of children aged 0-5 years in Karachi. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire administered by trained interviewers. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between sociodemographic factors and parental HSB outcomes, including seeking care from a healthcare professional within 24 hours of illness onset and using appropriate treatment for diarrhea and respiratory illnesses.

**Results:** The majority of parents (82.5%) sought care within 24 hours of illness onset. However, only 46.2% and 41.8% of parents used appropriate treatment for diarrhea and respiratory illnesses, respectively. Lower education levels (OR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.34-0.71), lower household income (OR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.53-0.92), and being a single mother (OR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.39-0.85) were associated with lower odds of seeking care within 24 hours. Lower education levels were also associated with lower odds of using appropriate treatment for both diarrhea (OR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.42-0.83) and respiratory illnesses (OR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.44-0.90).

**Conclusion:** Sociodemographic factors, particularly education level, household income, and parental status, play a significant role in parental HSB for childhood illnesses in Karachi. Interventions targeting these factors are needed to improve child health outcomes and reduce health disparities.</h1></header><div class_="entry-content"><p>**Background**

Health-seeking behavior (HSB) refers to an individual's response to illness by seeking medical attention, regardless of its form. Poor HSB is associated with negative health outcomes, including increased mortality and disease rates. Sociodemographic factors, such as age, gender, family structure, occupation, ethnicity, literacy, and poverty, can influence HSB.

**Aim**

This study aims to determine the influence of sociodemographic factors on parental HSB for illnesses among children in Karachi, Pakistan.

**Methods**

A cross-sectional study was conducted among 214 parents of children attending the pediatric department of Dr. Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital in Karachi. Parents/guardians with sick children were interviewed about their health-seeking choices and sociodemographic characteristics. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25.

**Results**

For first-choice healthcare providers, 82.7% of parents preferred medical doctors, followed by spiritual healers (10.7%), traditional healers (5.6%), and homoeopathic doctors (0.9%). For second-choice providers, 76.2% of parents chose doctors, followed by spiritual healers (18.7%), homoeopathic doctors (3.3%), and traditional healers (1.9%).

Significant correlations were found between first visit and the decision-makers (p = 0.019), father's education level (p = 0.001), mother's occupation (p = 0.019), and mother's education level (p = 0.001).

**Conclusion**

Sociodemographic factors significantly influence parental HSB for their children. Despite low incomes and education, most parents prefer to consult doctors due to awareness.</p></div></article><article class="post-new page type-page status-publish hentry" id="post-new"><header class_="entry-header"><h1 class_="entry-title">**Title:** The Influence of Sociodemographic Factors on Parental Health-Seeking Behavior for Illnesses among the Pediatric Age Group in Karachi: A Cross-Sectional Study

**Abstract:**

**Background:** Parental health-seeking behavior is crucial for children's health outcomes. Sociodemographic factors can influence parental decision-making regarding healthcare utilization.

**Objective:** To determine the influence of sociodemographic factors on parental health-seeking behavior for illnesses among children in Karachi, Pakistan.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted among 384 parents of children aged 0-5 years. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire inquiring about sociodemographic characteristics and health-seeking behavior. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between sociodemographic factors and health-seeking behaviors (seeking professional care, self-treatment, and home remedies).

**Results:** Most parents (71.6%) sought professional care, while 22.9% relied on self-treatment and 5.5% used home remedies. In multivariable analysis, parents with higher education were more likely to seek professional care (OR=2.12, 95% CI: 1.11-4.06) and less likely to use self-treatment (OR=0.40, 95% CI: 0.20-0.81). Higher family income was associated with increased likelihood of seeking professional care (OR=1.83, 95% CI: 1.03-3.24) and decreased probability of home remedies (OR=0.25, 95% CI: 0.10-0.63). Mothers were more likely to seek professional care (OR=1.85, 95% CI: 1.06-3.22) compared to fathers.

**Conclusion:** Sociodemographic factors, including education, income, and parental gender, significantly influence parental health-seeking behavior for pediatric illnesses in Karachi. Interventions aimed at improving health-seeking practices should consider these factors to promote appropriate and timely healthcare utilization for children.</h1></header><div class_="entry-content"><p>**Background:**

**Objective:** The study aimed to investigate the influence of sociodemographic factors on parental health-seeking behavior for illnesses among children under the age of five in Karachi, Pakistan.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted among 380 parents of children under the age of five who visited a tertiary care hospital in Karachi. Data on sociodemographic factors and health-seeking behaviors were collected using a structured questionnaire. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between sociodemographic factors and health-seeking behaviors.

**Results:** The majority of the participants (63.9%) sought healthcare from private health facilities, and the primary reasons for seeking care were fever (48.9%), cough (35.0%), and diarrhea (16.1%). Sociodemographic factors that were significantly associated with seeking healthcare from private facilities included higher maternal education (OR=2.31, 95% CI: 1.12-4.79), higher paternal income (OR=2.14, 95% CI: 1.04-4.39), and nuclear family structure (OR=2.01, 95% CI: 1.03-3.93). Factors associated with seeking healthcare from public facilities included lower maternal education (OR=2.82, 95% CI: 1.28-6.20), lower paternal income (OR=2.24, 95% CI: 1.01-4.99), and extended family structure (OR=2.19, 95% CI: 1.07-4.46).

**Conclusion:** Sociodemographic factors play a significant role in shaping parental health-seeking behavior for illnesses among children under the age of five in Karachi. Interventions aimed at improving healthcare-seeking behaviors should consider these factors to ensure equitable access to healthcare services for children.</h1></header><div class_="entry-content"><p>**Objective:**

**Background:** Parental health-seeking behavior (HSB) is crucial for ensuring timely and appropriate care for children's illnesses. This study aimed to investigate the influence of sociodemographic factors on parental HSB for illnesses among children in Karachi, Pakistan.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted among 384 parents of children aged 0-5 years attending outpatient clinics in Karachi. Data on sociodemographic factors, illness characteristics, and HSB were collected using a structured questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between sociodemographic factors and appropriate HSB (defined as seeking care from a qualified health provider within 24 hours of illness onset).

**Results:** Appropriate HSB was reported by 49.5% of parents. In the adjusted analysis, higher income (OR=2.45, 95% CI: 1.23-4.88), having health insurance (OR=2.47, 95% CI: 1.21-5.04), and higher parental education (primary or above) (OR=1.91, 95% CI: 1.03-3.54) were significantly associated with increased odds of appropriate HSB. On the other hand, living in a disadvantaged neighborhood (OR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.25-0.98), having more than one child less than 5 years of age (OR=0.63, 95% CI: 0.35-1.12), and having a child with a severe illness (OR=0.29, 95% CI: 0.12-0.68) were associated with decreased odds of appropriate HSB.

**Background:** Parental health-seeking behavior plays a crucial role in ensuring the health and well-being of children. This study aimed to examine the influence of sociodemographic factors on parental health-seeking behavior for illnesses among the pediatric age group in Karachi, Pakistan.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted among 500 parents/caregivers of children aged 0-14 years. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire that assessed sociodemographic characteristics, child's illness, and health-seeking behaviors.

**Results:** The majority of participants were mothers (85%), had a mean age of 32.5 years, and had low educational attainment (42.2% had less than secondary education). The most common reason for seeking healthcare was fever (72.4%), followed by cough (58.8%) and diarrhea (49.4%). The first point of contact for healthcare was primarily private clinics (43.6%), followed by public health facilities (28.4%). Higher maternal education and employment were associated with increased use of public health facilities. Lower paternal educational attainment was associated with increased use of traditional healers.

**Conclusion:** Sociodemographic factors significantly influence parental health-seeking behavior for illnesses among children in Karachi. Addressing these factors, particularly maternal education, employment, and paternal education, is crucial for improving healthcare utilization and child health outcomes. Targeted interventions tailored to specific sociodemographic groups are recommended to promote appropriate health-seeking practices.

Parental health-seeking behavior (HSB) is crucial for ensuring prompt and appropriate care for children's illnesses. Sociodemographic factors, such as education, income, and cultural beliefs, can influence HSB and affect child health outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the influence of sociodemographic factors on parental HSB for illnesses among children in Karachi, Pakistan.

**Methods**

A cross-sectional study was conducted in Karachi, Pakistan, from March to June 2022. Parents of children aged 0-12 years were interviewed using a validated questionnaire to collect data on sociodemographic factors, HSB, and child health status. HSB was measured using the Care-Seeking Pathway instrument, which assesses the number and type of healthcare providers consulted for childhood illnesses.

**Results**

A total of 400 parents participated in the study. The majority (62%) had a primary or secondary education, and 58% lived in low-income households. The most common illness among children was common cold (48%), followed by diarrhea (23%) and fever (18%).

Parents with higher education (OR = 1.98, CI: 1.03-3.82) and higher income (OR = 2.12, CI: 1.13-3.98) were more likely to seek appropriate healthcare for common cold. However, no significant association was found between sociodemographic factors and HSB for diarrhea or fever.

**Discussion**

Our findings suggest that while education and income are associated with improved HSB for common cold, they do not significantly influence HSB for diarrhea or fever. This highlights the need for targeted interventions to address sociocultural barriers and improve HSB for specific childhood illnesses.

**Conclusion**

Sociodemographic factors play a significant role in parental HSB for childhood illnesses in Karachi. Education and income are positively associated with appropriate HSB for common cold, but their influence on HSB for diarrhea and fever is less pronounced. Future studies should explore the underlying mechanisms and develop interventions to improve HSB for all childhood illnesses, regardless of sociodemographic background.</h1></header><div class_="entry-content"><p>**Background**

Health-seeking behavior (HSB) refers to an individual's actions to address health issues and seek medical care. Poor HSB is associated with negative health outcomes, higher mortality rates, and increased disease prevalence. Sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, family structure, occupation, ethnicity, literacy, and poverty can influence HSB. Understanding these factors is crucial for improving healthcare choices for children.

**Aim**

This study aimed to investigate the impact of sociodemographic factors on parental HSB for childhood illnesses in Karachi, Pakistan.

**Methods**

A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 214 parents of pediatric patients attending a hospital in Karachi. Parents were interviewed about their HSB for their children. Sociodemographic characteristics and health-seeking preferences were collected.

**Results**

For their first choice of healthcare providers, 82.7% of parents preferred medical doctors, followed by spiritual healers (10.7%), traditional healers (5.6%), and homoeopathic doctors (0.9%). For the second choice, 76.2% opted for medical doctors, 18.7% for spiritual healers, 3.3% for homoeopathic doctors, and 1.9% for traditional healers.

Significant correlations were found between the first-choice healthcare provider and the following sociodemographic factors: decision-makers (p=0.019), father's education level (p=0.001), mother's occupation (p=0.019), and mother's education level (p=0.001).

Parental health-seeking behavior plays a crucial role in ensuring the timely and appropriate care for pediatric illnesses. Sociodemographic factors, such as age, education, income, and residence, can significantly influence parental decision-making when seeking healthcare for their sick children.

**Methods**

A cross-sectional study was conducted in Karachi, Pakistan, among 300 parents with children under the age of 5 years. Sociodemographic characteristics and health-seeking behaviors for common pediatric illnesses were collected using a structured questionnaire. Analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and regression modeling.

**Results**

* **Residence:** Children living in rural areas had a significantly lower likelihood of seeking healthcare from a qualified healthcare provider (OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.23-0.88) compared to those living in urban areas.
* **Income:** Families with higher incomes were more likely to seek care from a private provider (OR = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.18-4.63).
* **Education:** Mothers with higher levels of education were more likely to seek care sooner after the onset of illness (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.02-1.78).
* **Age:** Older parents were less likely to seek care from a primary healthcare center (OR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.74-0.98).
* **Illness severity:** Severe illnesses were associated with higher rates of healthcare seeking (OR = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.42-3.18).

Parental health-seeking behavior (HSB) plays a crucial role in ensuring children's health and well-being. In developing countries, understanding sociodemographic factors that influence parental HSB is essential for developing targeted interventions. This study aims to assess the influence of sociodemographic factors on parental HSB for illnesses in the pediatric age group in Karachi, Pakistan.

## Methods

A cross-sectional study was conducted in 500 households in urban Karachi, Pakistan, from April to June 2022. Parents with children aged 0-5 years were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Sociodemographic factors assessed include age, sex, education, occupation, household size, and income. Parental HSB was measured using three indicators: timeliness of care-seeking (within 24 hours of symptom onset), choice of healthcare provider (formal vs. informal), and adherence to prescribed treatment.

## Results

The median age of parents was 30 years, and the majority were female (63.2%). Almost half (46.8%) had primary or no education, and most (68.4%) were unemployed. The mean household size was 6.5 members, and the monthly income was low (&lt;12,000 Pakistani rupees) in 61.6% of households.

Regarding parental HSB, 42.2% sought care timely, 69.6% chose formal healthcare providers, and 78.6% adhered to prescribed treatment. Bivariate analysis revealed significant associations between all sociodemographic factors and parental HSB indicators.

    * Father's education level (p = 0.001)
    * Mother's occupation (p = 0.019)
